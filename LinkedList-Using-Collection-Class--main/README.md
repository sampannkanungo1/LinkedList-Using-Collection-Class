# LinkedList-Using-Collection-Class-
STEPS:
LinkedList class extends AbstractSequentialList and implements List,Deque and Queue inteface.
It can be used as List, stack or Queue as it implements all the related interfaces.
It allows null entry.
It is dynamic in nature i.e it allocates memory when required. Therefore insertion and deletion operations can be easily implemented.
It can contain duplicate elements and it is not synchronized.
Reverse Traversing is difficult in linked list.
In LinkedList, manipulation is fast because no shifting needs to be occurred.
